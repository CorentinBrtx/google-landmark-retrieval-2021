# Kaggle Challenge: Google Landmark Retrieval 2021

This is part of a project for the Deep Learning course of CentraleSup√©lec.

This repository contains the code for the Kaggle challenge: [Google Landmark Retrieval 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-landmark-retrieval-2021).

The idea of the model used comes from the 2020 winner [google_landmark_retrieval_1st_place_solution](https://github.com/seungkee/google_landmark_retrieval_2020_1st_place_solution), and the code was adapted from the adaptive margin loss tutorial [Emkademy](https://github.com/kivancyuksel/emkademy).
